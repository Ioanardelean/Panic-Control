Panic control is a alerting and  monitoring tool to stay in control of the uptime and functionality of your websites and servers.

For PanicControl you need to install postgre database <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>  and fakesmtp <http://nilhcem.com/FakeSMTP/download.html >.

Once is done to download an install, `clone the repo` and change into **config.json** the database credentials like _name_, _database_ and _password_.

To complete yout task, Fake smtp do the same things, juste replace your listening port into config file, example `25`. 
run `npm install`, and you can use Panic!
**Package.json** is your bible!
