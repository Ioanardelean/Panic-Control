**Everyone that has a website is aware that sometimes things can go wrong.**

Panic control is the ultimate tool that helps you to monitor the availability, performance and functionalities of your website and APIs. 
Moreover, it is able to send you an alert when something breaks. 

We all know that every downtime is impacting the business: additional costs, unhappy customers, new solutions needed for a better monitoring. 
Now it's the time for personalized monitoring: you can monitor your website with your own configuration, set your own message alert and get immediately noticed when a downtime occurs.  
If your website goes down an email is sent to alert you or multiple email addresses. Email alerts are sent after a website remains down for 10, 20, 30 or 60 seconds. The interval of each re-check is chosen by the user to ensure an uptime tailored to the user's needs. After the downtime alert is sent a repeat request is made to your server after 10 minutes. The uptime responses are displayed into the dashboard page also. 
Your monitors can be stopped and started for the maintenance period of your website to evite useless alerts. 

And not only that, you can have statistics about all the incidents that happened in the last month, in the current year or since you created the monitor.
